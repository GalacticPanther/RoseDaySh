    Isliye tu hara dhaniya le(I dont like dhaniya tho)</h1>

    <p class="hehe">Today is all about celebrating you, my heart, my love. The day I gift you this rose(abhi dhaniya le budget badhne pe rose bhi deta hoðŸ™‚) is a small symbol of how much you mean to me. Words can never express the depth of my feelings for you, but I'll spend every day trying to show you just how special you are. (Tere liye side mei 2 bille laga diye phool barsane ke liye)</p>

            Ohh My Shravani,<br><br>
            On this special day, I just wanted to remind you of how much you mean to me. Like this rose, my love for you keeps on growing with every passing day. You are the reason behind my happiness, the deepest desire of my heart, and the smile on my face even in the toughest times. With each petal, I think of all the beautiful memories we have had and all those yet to come. I feel so lucky and grateful to have you by my side, and I promise to cherish you for all eternity. I love you more than words can say, now and always!
        </p>
